# Analysis of CSR Reporting in the Food & Beverage Industry using R

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a set of practices and principles applied by companies to integrate the societal and environmental concerns into their business planning and operations. In this project we analyse and present the findings from the filings made by companies in the Food & Beverage industry with respect to their CSR reporting on four key critical areas of greenhouse gas emissions, diversity, employee health & safety, and customer welfare. To derive observations and insights from the data on reports, text analysis was used. The results of the analysis showed a steady growth in CSR reporting across all the regions. Greenhouse gas emissions and diversity were addressed more frequently in the European region while employee health & safety and customer welfare mostly in Asia. The whole project was conducted in R.
